# Bendix G-15 Boards
KiCad re-creations of the schematics and boards for the Bendix G-15.

These boards are meant to be functional drop in replacements for the original boards, whether they are damaged or missing.
The idea is either:
- To drill out the rivets on the original card's frames, desolder the wires for the tube sockets/etc and rivet/solder in the new board.
- Build up oragami PCBs to build a card frame.

Currently the goal is to get all schematics and boards layed out for the G-15 CPU and get a CPU at the System Source Computer Museum up and running using replacement boards.

## TODO
- Find suitable replacement diodes/transistors. This will be determined by component parameter analysis, specification comparison, and functional testing of boards with replaced components.
- Add oragami PCBs to allow building your own card handles to assemble around the boards.
